This program will take the area code you're interested in, the
nodelist file you wish to scan, and produce a report on the nodelist
entries in that area code, sorted by the city.  It is useful for
offering individuals a list of FidoNet systems which are in a
particular area code so that they might find systems which are local
to them.

Entries which have duplicate phone numbers are excluded from the
report and the first occurance of the phone number entry is reported.
Entries with the CDN nodelist flags are excluded from the list.

The command-line argument looks like this:

        NodeArea {area code} {nodelist file}

The output is placed into the NODEAREA.OUT report file.

The program exits with an ERRORLEVEL value:

                No_Problem                      0

        There was no problem and the program terminated normally.

                Operator_Aborted                1

        The operator hit [ESCAPE] while the program was searching.

                No_AreaCode_Argument            10

        The command-line area code argument is missing.

                AreaCode_Is_Invalid             11

        The area code looks bad.  It needs a three digit number.

                Cant_Find_Nodelist_File         12

        The nodelist file offered couldn't be found.

                Cant_Create_Report_File         13

        The NODEAREA.OUT file couldn't be created.

                No_Memory                       14

        The program simply ran out of memory.
